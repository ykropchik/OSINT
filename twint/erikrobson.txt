1506861926264946692 2022-03-24 15:14:14 +1000 <ErikRobson> @Mal_loc I think we were coming at it from dramatically different angles. üòÅ
1506858375253946371 2022-03-24 15:00:07 +1000 <ErikRobson> I'm not someone who's generally socially comfortable.  The few times I went, while I enjoyed the lectures/round tables, it really looked like a lot of the important stuff was happening informally. üòê
1506858374188593153 2022-03-24 15:00:07 +1000 <ErikRobson> Has anyone ever talked about the minimum level of social comfort necessary to really enjoy GDC?
1506851494821531648 2022-03-24 14:32:46 +1000 <ErikRobson> Over the course of 12 hours, my 8 YO son: *Learned about Garfield, decided he loves Garfield. *Learned about doge, started speaking in doge.  https://t.co/fIjbqDGug8
1506846750329372674 2022-03-24 14:13:55 +1000 <ErikRobson> @docsquiddy If you can't handle me at my horse, you don't deserve me at my platypus.
1506838938337439746 2022-03-24 13:42:53 +1000 <ErikRobson> If comedy has taught me anything, it's that horses have long faces.
1506481385975943176 2022-03-23 14:02:06 +1000 <ErikRobson> And there we are.  800 hours in Grim Dawn, my most-played Steam game.  Psst @GrimDawn &lt;call me gesture&gt;Farthest Frontier testing&lt;/call me gesture&gt;  https://t.co/isd3Adwuyi
1506475803382407171 2022-03-23 13:39:55 +1000 <ErikRobson> @timjung_ Dang, I've got a hang-up.  I haven't been able to trust Ridley Scott since Prometheus.  (And I've given him chances, only to get burned again.)
1506474798662094851 2022-03-23 13:35:55 +1000 <ErikRobson> @slimyswampghost I'm drinks.  Thanks for having 2 of me.
1506474518281293825 2022-03-23 13:34:48 +1000 <ErikRobson> Why TF is the trade paperback of JLA: Trial by Fire out of print?
1506467288853073922 2022-03-23 13:06:05 +1000 <ErikRobson> @The_Rabbit42 Yup.
1506440563100315653 2022-03-23 11:19:53 +1000 <ErikRobson> @svelle1 Maybe, someone somewhere.  But not me.
1506397456858181632 2022-03-23 08:28:35 +1000 <ErikRobson> @docsquiddy 25 hours, man?  That's an awful lot.  I mean, I'm happy with 10 max.  (Granted, I don't know your game!)
1506396912877912064 2022-03-23 08:26:26 +1000 <ErikRobson> @smariano_ai Oh no
1506395123046703105 2022-03-23 08:19:19 +1000 <ErikRobson> @JLHGameArt Yeah, I had a few issues with VS on SteamDeck.  It's basically running inside a browser window (it uses Phaser, an HTML5 engine.)  So I wonder what subset of things are going under-accelerated there.
1506391380054081537 2022-03-23 08:04:27 +1000 <ErikRobson> We actually did have this setup as a prototype map, and it was fun, but auto-battlers didn't exist yet and we couldn't pry our minds open enough to seriously consider it.
1506391378900647939 2022-03-23 08:04:26 +1000 <ErikRobson> FWIW, I think Brutal Legend probably could've worked as something akin to an auto-battler.  Keep double-teams and free-roaming avatars; basically, you remove orders and turn maps linear.

1506335987294633984 2022-03-23 04:24:20 +1000 <ErikRobson> @jonjones Maybe this is why I enjoy watching it but not playing it.
1506313539870285824 2022-03-23 02:55:08 +1000 <ErikRobson> @costar_s @docsquiddy This is why I wish games from MENA countries were 1)more plentiful and 2)more actively-highlighted.    Incredibly rich mythologies to inform kinds of "fantasy" that we barely ever see.
1506269544540610563 2022-03-23 00:00:19 +1000 <ErikRobson> @MFrooninckx Yeah, but it was hard and not very satisfying.
1506136283613081608 2022-03-22 15:10:47 +1000 <ErikRobson> @adam_orth Gonna have a leaky handle, as always.  Right at the seam.
1506103136250843137 2022-03-22 12:59:04 +1000 <ErikRobson> @HunterBlackComx Me neither, but whenever it's streaming I look forward to it.

1506079516472446977 2022-03-22 11:25:12 +1000 <ErikRobson> It's a shame the time passed for Big Numbers.  That series would've been amazing.

1506023806099369988 2022-03-22 07:43:50 +1000 <ErikRobson> @Arrqh Holy hell, if there's not a cat in every screenshot I see from now on I'm pitching a 24/7 fit.
1506023234113732610 2022-03-22 07:41:34 +1000 <ErikRobson> @mac_shirk @AntonHand Unity's first schtick was games running in the browser, IIRC.  They had one about a bull in a china shop and I think another about a giraffe in space with a jetpack(?!?)
1506021921334325248 2022-03-22 07:36:21 +1000 <ErikRobson> @mac_shirk @AntonHand Quake [2] vs Unreal [1] was the OG licensed engine war, right?  And Unreal, which came along second, was like, "bigger worlds!  Portals!  No map leaks!"  And Q's response was, "more hirable modders know how to make levels for our engine!"  (True at the time.)

1505985015066206209 2022-03-22 05:09:42 +1000 <ErikRobson> Not great.
1505938942842925064 2022-03-22 02:06:37 +1000 <ErikRobson> @mdabaie That was around the first time I started hearing about it (on Art Bell's overnight radio show.)

1505680839039877122 2022-03-21 09:01:00 +1000 <ErikRobson> @The_Rabbit42 ...because I suffer from a genie's curse, yes.

1505660907149357059 2022-03-21 07:41:48 +1000 <ErikRobson> @trumwill Ah, yeah, I can imagine it backfiring if your wearing a mask is read as anomalous.

1505650370046935041 2022-03-21 06:59:56 +1000 <ErikRobson> @trumwill Hey, one great thing about still wearing a good mask in public/around others: If you cough, you just point to your mask and gesture like, "hey, you're safe.  Masked, yo."
1505625702225248259 2022-03-21 05:21:55 +1000 <ErikRobson> @Atrix256 @humanHologram I only remember hearing that burning it is very, very bad.

1505145483802468353 2022-03-19 21:33:42 +1000 <ErikRobson> Omicron is giving me game dev future-proof naming convention anxiety.
1505143447983775749 2022-03-19 21:25:36 +1000 <ErikRobson> @RossJosephG I've only been to NO once, but holy hell, I love it so dearly.
1505138530858676224 2022-03-19 21:06:04 +1000 <ErikRobson> *4th official game in the series.
1505138529738772482 2022-03-19 21:06:04 +1000 <ErikRobson> ...and a bunch of 4D trash the aliens left behind.  I really hope they nail the upcoming sequel*.
1505138528484691971 2022-03-19 21:06:03 +1000 <ErikRobson> I always hesitate to call The Lighthouse horror, but I'll happily call STALKER horror.  Sure, it has significant FPS and RPG elements.  But the core energy all emerges from its horror.  A miserable place full of miserable, violent people.
1505136424869277698 2022-03-19 20:57:42 +1000 <ErikRobson> @joewintergreen Oh.  Wow.
1505133966033969154 2022-03-19 20:47:56 +1000 <ErikRobson> @docsquiddy Oops I mixed up whether selfishness was good or bad.  Sorry 'bout that.  For the record, selflessness is GOOD.
1505130798550175747 2022-03-19 20:35:21 +1000 <ErikRobson> I wonder if research-capable humanity will ever manage to decipher the mechanics behind dreams.  It feels like something that will probably be akin to fingerprints (bizarre and mostly unpredictable, per person.)  And that probably makes it a much harder problem.
1505126095091240962 2022-03-19 20:16:39 +1000 <ErikRobson> @less_soft_bird @docsquiddy It's got old school quicksave/quickload; don't hesitate to use them.
1505125777406234627 2022-03-19 20:15:23 +1000 <ErikRobson> @dirty_librarian @bewgtweets (Just above it in the picture is @asherperlman's Dog vs Genie cartoon, btw.  Yes, it's a genie joke collection.)
1505125012524568576 2022-03-19 20:12:21 +1000 <ErikRobson> @less_soft_bird @docsquiddy It is ABSOLUTELY not for everyone.  There are bugs, still.  It's ruthless.  Fighting at night is harder, but there's no sleep action.  Etc.  Basically, the Zone doesn't want you.  It's trying to kill you.  But it holds untold riches.
1505122769855397889 2022-03-19 20:03:26 +1000 <ErikRobson> @docsquiddy But also, just‚Ä¶ that sound design.
1505120904690368512 2022-03-19 19:56:02 +1000 <ErikRobson> @docsquiddy Oops!   Sorry.  I want off.  In fairness, you mentioned STALKER.
1505120588028731392 2022-03-19 19:54:46 +1000 <ErikRobson> @docsquiddy So while I'm getting and processing these hints, the world is busy being the most atmospheric place I've ever seen.  And they're blending the static (conventional level design) with the systemic (world systems that impose additional events and context atop the static.)
1505119527721312261 2022-03-19 19:50:33 +1000 <ErikRobson> @docsquiddy That's when it started to click - the Zone isn't a set of game levels.  It's locations that follow Life Rules (extremely brutal eastern European Life Rules, at that.)
1505118893844545540 2022-03-19 19:48:02 +1000 <ErikRobson> @docsquiddy My second hint was the guy down the road from the starting location whose dialog options present a "selfish" and "selfless" (i.e. good) option.  If you choose good, he immediately double-crosses you.  I don't know if it's inevitable, but I died there.
1505118456043081728 2022-03-19 19:46:18 +1000 <ErikRobson> @docsquiddy I've spent an awful lot of time trying to understand why STALKER was so damn good.  For me the first hint was that it didn't hand out power-ups/weapons/rewards like other games.  This wasn't going to be about being rewarded for thinking like the designers.

1505045444639875072 2022-03-19 14:56:11 +1000 <ErikRobson> @Qt3 Understood, thanks.  Do me a favor and remind him he's missed.

1505015340899610627 2022-03-19 12:56:33 +1000 <ErikRobson> @dirty_librarian @bewgtweets Literally on my fridge.  https://t.co/oEVmWCo1AO
1504940320416358405 2022-03-19 07:58:27 +1000 <ErikRobson> @AlenL Interesting. That's the boat *I'm* in - I haven't gotten COVID yet, and have no long COVID symptoms.  I do feel like lockdown fatigue has taken its toll on me.  However, what people with long COVID describe sounds way more serious and debilitating.
1504921378717282304 2022-03-19 06:43:11 +1000 <ErikRobson> @bitshifternz @ZPostFacto @basisspace I know of one, but it's not well-regarded in the US medical community because it lets any old troll post anonymously.  https://t.co/SEImUZFQMp
1504906419232919555 2022-03-19 05:43:44 +1000 <ErikRobson> @GeneralJeevicus I started it at one point, and I don't remember why I stopped.  So yeah, I'll pick it back up.  (It probably doesn't get as weird with enemies and such, though, right?)
1504877956434255873 2022-03-19 03:50:38 +1000 <ErikRobson> Hey @Qt3 - there's a hole in my life where Kelly Wand's movie synopses used to be; aside from his day job, is he producing material elsewhere that I don't know about?  (Ideally him performing stuff he's written?)

1504842727501950976 2022-03-19 01:30:39 +1000 <ErikRobson> @ZPostFacto @molecularmusing @basisspace Yep.  Again, I‚Äôm skeptical but open to that possibility.  For my part, I had very little reaction to the first 2 shots, but the 3rd did knock me out for a day.
1504821370865139716 2022-03-19 00:05:47 +1000 <ErikRobson> @doruksega Yes!
1504689497174290435 2022-03-18 15:21:46 +1000 <ErikRobson> @cs_spicy @ZPostFacto That‚Äôs not even age-related.  Everyone seems to have had a unique response to each shot.  It‚Äôs kind of wild.
1504688883836936192 2022-03-18 15:19:20 +1000 <ErikRobson> As a mid-GenXer, if the Beatles taught me anything, it‚Äôs that chords, melodies, and harmonies endure, while arrangements and instrumentation age quickly.
1504686715809648641 2022-03-18 15:10:43 +1000 <ErikRobson> @MattSaincome Nobel noms are free.  I‚Äôll nominate you for a small large fee.

1504628975078809601 2022-03-18 11:21:16 +1000 <ErikRobson> (I should be clear: Not because Ukrainians would make such a game, but because those elements are active in the general public conversation at this point.)
1504628498266488832 2022-03-18 11:19:23 +1000 <ErikRobson> @GalaOfWonder @DavidElfstrom I know, right?  So many people making something so simple complicated.
1504627758101540866 2022-03-18 11:16:26 +1000 <ErikRobson> @joeludwig @Jim__Partridge That's been my response to every other Souls game.  On this one I finally made myself get far enough in (2.4 hours) to feel like I could honestly say I got the basics of combat.  Then I uninstalled.  But I love when people post videos of it.
1504627131229224960 2022-03-18 11:13:57 +1000 <ErikRobson> So any bets on how soon we'll see an FPS centered around using Javelins to take out invading tanks?  You better believe I have a whole design doc in my head, but I wouldn't have the stomach to make it.

1504624476557783050 2022-03-18 11:03:24 +1000 <ErikRobson> @MatthewDownhour Top-tier tweet.
1504620233964761112 2022-03-18 10:46:32 +1000 <ErikRobson> @CDonnaile I can't say how it rates against the median survival game, unfortunately.
1504619999268286477 2022-03-18 10:45:36 +1000 <ErikRobson> @CDonnaile I'm extremely vulnerable to horror in video games, so the way it balanced those elements is what drew me to it (and eventually what made me stop playing, paradoxically.)
1504619689284055055 2022-03-18 10:44:23 +1000 <ErikRobson> @CDonnaile Well... personal taste gonna taste.

1504615681463005192 2022-03-18 10:28:27 +1000 <ErikRobson> @ZPostFacto Absolutely.
1504613992970432519 2022-03-18 10:21:44 +1000 <ErikRobson> @ZPostFacto My family is currently experiencing the downsides of COVID hawkism - the kids just finally returned to school about a month ago, and social re-integration is a real struggle.  There was no flawless path through any of this unless, I don't know, you were hopped up on Dune spice.
1504613096802856967 2022-03-18 10:18:11 +1000 <ErikRobson> @ZPostFacto Wow.  The scientist urge to pack all your infographics into the smallest possible space.  https://t.co/PajPJP4L6F
1504612376468893697 2022-03-18 10:15:19 +1000 <ErikRobson> @ZPostFacto But my main point is about being mad at the bad faith actors abusing an opportunity to push disinfo and/or grifts.  (And again, that's not you.  Except for the Scientology pamphlet you gave me.  That was kinda weird.)
1504611776922497032 2022-03-18 10:12:56 +1000 <ErikRobson> @ZPostFacto And if a bunch of data emerges that the phenomenon is a for reals thing, I'm here for it.  (Except that'll suck because it'll represent a systemic downside to the otherwise miraculous-seeming mRNA vaccine tech.)
1504611265032859655 2022-03-18 10:10:54 +1000 <ErikRobson> @ZPostFacto I might be interrupting mid-response just because Internet talkin' is so slow.  So sorry if that.  At a high level, I'm not taking issue with anyone who believes they got symptoms from an immune response to the vaccine /in good faith/.  You definitely fall into that category.
1504609985442983939 2022-03-18 10:05:49 +1000 <ErikRobson> @ZPostFacto It would be irresponsible of me to confirm or deny. üôÉ

1504590308515803148 2022-03-18 08:47:38 +1000 <ErikRobson> I wish I could forget everything about The Forest and play it fresh again.  Such an unnerving-but-engaging game.

1504585963661455360 2022-03-18 08:30:22 +1000 <ErikRobson> @anthrolo @zillowgonewild ngl, I had the same thought looking at this.

1504582068767846401 2022-03-18 08:14:53 +1000 <ErikRobson> @jsundmanus And she always had to find some gentle way to say, "look... we don't currently know how we're going to pay for their food tomorrow, so you might need to be flexible here."
1504581777225969684 2022-03-18 08:13:44 +1000 <ErikRobson> @jsundmanus So much this.  My wife worked at a Zambian orphanage for a year doing charity outreach.  Americans would donate with stipulations like, "we want to make sure the kids have fast computers" or "this is for a fancy swing set."
1504579370177818640 2022-03-18 08:04:10 +1000 <ErikRobson> Yall need to leave this guy alone and let him finish his next game.  This is really important.
1504578400605728770 2022-03-18 08:00:19 +1000 <ErikRobson> @Sbb696969 That's the spirit!

1504556150578036737 2022-03-18 06:31:54 +1000 <ErikRobson> It's wild that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has people thinking and talking about conventional ground war again.
1504552806019055629 2022-03-18 06:18:36 +1000 <ErikRobson> @lizaledwards Good lord.
1504549157276565518 2022-03-18 06:04:06 +1000 <ErikRobson> @DukeToma Yeah, I good point.  I remember reading a few years ago that the history of anti-vacc movements in the US is basically as old as vaccines themselves. üòµ‚Äçüí´
1504548540911009797 2022-03-18 06:01:39 +1000 <ErikRobson> @LeaderGrev Absolutely!  I actually do (or did when it was relevant to my life) apply the same standard to myself, and noped out of a fair number of situations because of doubt.
1504533548551729161 2022-03-18 05:02:05 +1000 <ErikRobson> @LeaderGrev I personally always adhered to the ‚Äúif it‚Äôs not a f--- yes, it‚Äôs a f--- no‚Äù model, even though (as you say) I never actually had the language to articulate that.  Great piece.  Talking about this stuff openly can only help.
1504529105546473473 2022-03-18 04:44:26 +1000 <ErikRobson> Amazon buys MGM.  Huh.  That's a big back catalog.  I don't know much about their current production capabilities, though.  https://t.co/f9ubZ4XYb1

1504524910529441806 2022-03-18 04:27:46 +1000 <ErikRobson> Here's the first thread I could find:  https://t.co/7mM502NEyC
1504524908788805633 2022-03-18 04:27:45 +1000 <ErikRobson> Wait... why is he still saying COVID has the same lethality as the flu?  Didn't this get called out and debunked a week ago?
1504520126724411392 2022-03-18 04:08:45 +1000 <ErikRobson> Nevertheless, the first category of such posters - those doing so in bad faith - really drive me up the wall.  At least the grifters are easy enough to spot and report.
1504520125759713291 2022-03-18 04:08:45 +1000 <ErikRobson> It's not consistent with my understanding of how the vaccine operates mechanically, though, so all I can do is stay skeptical of the origin story while remaining supportive of someone who's suffering from VERY REAL long-term symptoms.
1504520124727914502 2022-03-18 04:08:45 +1000 <ErikRobson> I have a friend who's NOT an anti-vaccer, but believes their long COVID symptoms came from their immune system's response to the vaccine.  And, like... I can't disprove that.  I'm not a scientist.  I don't run studies or trials or labs.
1504520123712892930 2022-03-18 04:08:44 +1000 <ErikRobson> Among those posting in good faith, I think many probably got COVID and blame the vaccine, perhaps unaware that the vacc doesn't *prevent* COVID.  (It merely reduces severity.)
1504520122735620111 2022-03-18 04:08:44 +1000 <ErikRobson> And I'm still unsure what to do with this material.  I'm sure a lot are just bad-faith anti-vaccers, grifters, or straight-up disinfo agents.
1504520121594703872 2022-03-18 04:08:44 +1000 <ErikRobson> I'm still seeing people slide into long COVID discussions, starting with a sympathetic "I know, I'm suffering from the same symptoms" and following it up with "it all started when I got the vaccine."
1504509578481848349 2022-03-18 03:26:50 +1000 <ErikRobson> @MargotHayes18 @loscharlos That person is an anti-vaccer pushing ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.
1504504505643282440 2022-03-18 03:06:41 +1000 <ErikRobson> @DorianGorski Yeah, I like it!

1504365405829099521 2022-03-17 17:53:57 +1000 <ErikRobson> @r_A460N Does it?  I haven't even tried it because my "gaming rig" is a crappy laptop.
1504344894558519297 2022-03-17 16:32:26 +1000 <ErikRobson> I think that's probably my dream game... the game I've been imagining since I was a kid - GTA5, but it acknowledges the existence of good people on a mechanic-level.
1504344195892334595 2022-03-17 16:29:40 +1000 <ErikRobson> WTF, man.  I just wanted to buy some fruit.  https://t.co/3rnXNCql6T
1504341331455348738 2022-03-17 16:18:17 +1000 <ErikRobson> Funny how shit gets kinda serious when you're talking about potential death or disability.
1504338320775548928 2022-03-17 16:06:19 +1000 <ErikRobson> @Home_Halfway Don't delete please.
1504337789013295108 2022-03-17 16:04:12 +1000 <ErikRobson> Well, if nothing else, COVID-19 has given me an opportunity to make lots of new enemies that I'll never meet and might otherwise have gotten along with.  https://t.co/m9HcgswQIe
1504336451332284417 2022-03-17 15:58:53 +1000 <ErikRobson>  https://t.co/HSA6fHvOhI
1504336444566880258 2022-03-17 15:58:52 +1000 <ErikRobson> 7. (Please ignore the roughly 30% of COVID victims with Long COVID symptoms.  The point is that infecting /everyone/ is the only true path toward freedom.  "Including masks.")
1504336443484753920 2022-03-17 15:58:52 +1000 <ErikRobson> 6. Therefore, exposure to the pandemic virus (including reinfection) is truly virtuous, for it's steeling our resolve against FUTURE variants.  1 million lives are but a small cost to pay, surely.
1504336442356498434 2022-03-17 15:58:51 +1000 <ErikRobson> 5. So the original tweet presupposes the COVID doves knew all along that exposure to OG and Delta would render the population somewhat more resilient against Omicron (which, again, they apparently predicted.)
1504336441232429058 2022-03-17 15:58:51 +1000 <ErikRobson> 4. What's happening in the countries being hit hard right now, highlighted in the original tweet, are likely because countries that handled OG and Delta extremely well relaxed restrictions and the much more virulent Omicron finally took hold.
1504336440146096128 2022-03-17 15:58:51 +1000 <ErikRobson> 3. As far as I know, no public official in the Trump or Biden admin ever talked about aspiring to achieve "COVID zero". And the fed-level policies certainly didn't approach anything like that.
1504336438720024576 2022-03-17 15:58:50 +1000 <ErikRobson> I'm trying to make sense of this take.  1. As I write this, 968,329 deaths in the US have been attributed to COVID-19. In this rhetorical frame, that all happened within a "COVID zero" policy.  2. (It's likely the real death count is about 1/3 higher - see excess death stats.)  https://t.co/HIz9sTlFQJ
1504326478862770178 2022-03-17 15:19:16 +1000 <ErikRobson> @SejanusClaudius ?
1504324143201751043 2022-03-17 15:09:59 +1000 <ErikRobson> @SieNoel YOW
1504324042995560450 2022-03-17 15:09:35 +1000 <ErikRobson> @SejanusClaudius I mean... she can do whatever she wants for any reason she wants.  That's fine.  I think I'm more curious about the incurious reporting of "we don't know why, but here's the rumor."  For the record, I'm a big fan of both acts.

1504322871581024260 2022-03-17 15:04:56 +1000 <ErikRobson> @SieNoel Like... I don't know what's in those kids' future, but it's really, really bad.
1504317549286068225 2022-03-17 14:43:47 +1000 <ErikRobson> @IsaacVail I admire the cultural agnosticism of this tweet.  I also got triggered by the apostrophe in "D'an" and am now envisioning a Lovecraftian Steely Dan cover band (because F'thagn).  Their cover of The Fez is so good it'll drive you mad.

1504298203457339392 2022-03-17 13:26:54 +1000 <ErikRobson> @TimOfLegend You know, I think that probably does answer my question.
1504298047831896069 2022-03-17 13:26:17 +1000 <ErikRobson> This feels like an op.  Or something.  Like trolls boosting Star Wars fan squabbles.  Aimee Mann and Steely Dan aren't opposites on any reasonable spectrum.  Doesn't make sense.
1504296276854116354 2022-03-17 13:19:15 +1000 <ErikRobson> @bmaz That doesn't make any sense to me.  I love them both.

1504294328021110793 2022-03-17 13:11:30 +1000 <ErikRobson> @rachaelschafer @CDCDirector @WhiteHouse I spent plenty of time shitting on the Trump admin's COVID response, but damn, I sure didn't expect Biden's response to take such a dark turn.  On balance, I'd call them roughly equivalent (each being bad for very different reasons...)

1504291737421815808 2022-03-17 13:01:13 +1000 <ErikRobson> @samir @zillowgonewild Now that's just gratuitous.
1504291437558390785 2022-03-17 13:00:01 +1000 <ErikRobson> @taylorcocke Personally, it clicked for me when I needed to reduce chicken marsala at a certain stage - like, oh, I want the wine essence, but I need to burn off some of the alcohol... makes sense!
1504290902889545728 2022-03-17 12:57:54 +1000 <ErikRobson> @taylorcocke (And "reduce" as a verb is "cook that liquid for a while (trust us)".)

1504280138581610496 2022-03-17 12:15:07 +1000 <ErikRobson> @FeedMe_ImBald I just learned that Phil Hartman was a year younger than I am (now) when he was murdered, and I've got the bubblin' rage now  There was some solace in reading the anecdote about Jon Lovitz' reaction when Andy Dick (sorta) taunted him about Hartman's death.  https://t.co/Y9A1ChpRZv
1504278420523401217 2022-03-17 12:08:18 +1000 <ErikRobson> @TheNC64 Well, as I actively strive to be generally successful without being famous, I feel like I'm still in a safe zone.
1504278057829351425 2022-03-17 12:06:51 +1000 <ErikRobson> Guys, MTG is the worst, but this is probably a mundane phone text-to-speech error.
1504277627732852740 2022-03-17 12:05:09 +1000 <ErikRobson> @FeedMe_ImBald Well, I'm just sayin'.  Zombie Brynn Omdahl wouldn't have craved brains for long.
1504276155402129408 2022-03-17 11:59:18 +1000 <ErikRobson> @MFrooninckx @johnbiggs Oh, yeah, totally.  The (potential) use case involves general isolation.
1504275913608863749 2022-03-17 11:58:20 +1000 <ErikRobson> Is it a violation of Twitter's ToS to say that if a specific dead person were still alive, you would personally kill them?
1504272675539091456 2022-03-17 11:45:28 +1000 <ErikRobson> @Mal_loc I technically knew this, but never listened to the song.  It's very weird to hear David Byrne just come out and say it.
1504269025173389312 2022-03-17 11:30:58 +1000 <ErikRobson> Creating an archival link into this thread.  I deleted the top-level because I misheard a word and got embarrassed, but the thread turned into something kind of cool.  https://t.co/ifvZygXnei
1504268605327740929 2022-03-17 11:29:18 +1000 <ErikRobson> @Mal_loc I've since been robbed of that notion, but I still like to pretend it's the case.
1504268437400408064 2022-03-17 11:28:38 +1000 <ErikRobson> @Mal_loc Yorke's vocals are loose enough that I thought he was hitting a G in the intro, rather than a G#, which turned a major chord into a minor.  In the middle of the song, he repeats the phrase, but it's (to me) more clearly a G#, which I thought was an AMAZING choice.
1504267917902245894 2022-03-17 11:26:34 +1000 <ErikRobson> @Mal_loc Shit, that's two gems you've dropped in my life today.  Can we just keep this thread going all night?  Incidentally, for a decade I had a... tonal mondegreen(?) with Radiohead's Pyramid Song...
1504266723561668613 2022-03-17 11:21:49 +1000 <ErikRobson> @IsaacVail Yeah, I feel like a little bit of a dum-dum, but that's okay.
1504266139852935171 2022-03-17 11:19:30 +1000 <ErikRobson> @Mal_loc Also, you should've seen the hijinks when I was sure he was saying "the scarab'll take my mind".  That honestly that sounds like a cooler song.
1504265215994523649 2022-03-17 11:15:50 +1000 <ErikRobson> @Mal_loc You're the winner!  Also, Willie... "mem'ry"?  Jesus Christ.  https://t.co/KcTDDA3peb

1504237992671555585 2022-03-17 09:27:39 +1000 <ErikRobson> @gary_schroeder @tomricks1 Yeah, I feel like it'd be counterproductive, to the degree that if there were such an attack I'd wonder whether it was actually ordered by Putin to inspire a nationalistic rally.
1504237209817268225 2022-03-17 09:24:32 +1000 <ErikRobson> @andreamatranga ...or in Russia, given Putin's new tendency to throw his military leaders under the bus.

1504153178274639877 2022-03-17 03:50:38 +1000 <ErikRobson> @joshtpm That has to be balanced against all of the private international businesses that suspended operations in Russia, which Putin said he has plans to claim and nationalize, lol.  Give a little, get a little.

1503933103009525761 2022-03-16 13:16:08 +1000 <ErikRobson> @hondanhon In an active production environment, I absolutely think this is true.

I'm curious about the space between "take it seriously" (first tweet) and "engage them seriously" (third.)  The first implies (to me) considering the potential truth of a concept.  The second implies a much broader, more complex...

1503909377878634499 2022-03-16 11:41:51 +1000 <ErikRobson> @nberlat Right, I'm not saying it can't be done, and I'm not trying to absolve.  I'm mostly trying to understand how a creative team might end up there.

1503906919894818816 2022-03-16 11:32:05 +1000 <ErikRobson> @nberlat That seems like it might be a tough line to walk, just because "lesbian" imagery has been so actively subverted for male gratification.  The line CAN be walked, but I can envision people just choosing to stay safe rather than enter territory they know they don't understand.

1503765038737211393 2022-03-16 02:08:18 +1000 <ErikRobson> @andreamatranga That fits with the idea of Trump being a sort of aspirational figure for many - he was able to say all the awful stuff they'd like to say and get away with it.

1503612080783429632 2022-03-15 16:00:30 +1000 <ErikRobson> @tametick I saw a leopard on the bus coming home today.  It took up two seats and wasn't wearing a mask.  Very dangerous Americans, leopards.
1503611347086413824 2022-03-15 15:57:35 +1000 <ErikRobson> Like... are a subset of CIA operatives just sociopaths?  I suppose a subset of everyone is sociopaths, but doesn't it seem like CIA sociopaths get a lot of work?  Every once in a while I wish we had direct democracy.

1503589300973146118 2022-03-15 14:29:59 +1000 <ErikRobson> People spend their entire lives mastering these things.  Why on Earth am I expecting to be happy with any of the results with a 4 hour/week investment?
1503589299932987394 2022-03-15 14:29:59 +1000 <ErikRobson> One of those nights where I move my laptop over to my music table, hook everything up, fire up the keyboard and Ableton, record something, and immediately question the entire endeavor.

1503549920711614469 2022-03-15 11:53:30 +1000 <ErikRobson> @SejanusClaudius I think I'd toss at least half this list.  Plant, Bono, Morrison, Daltrey, Cornell.  Was Lennon the "lead singer" of the Beatles?  I thought that was an even split between John &amp; Paul.  And is Mick Jagger a "good singer?"  A showy front-man, for sure, but...

1502253468764958721 2022-03-11 22:01:52 +1000 <ErikRobson> @EvilGuineaMugu Just speaking for myself, it had to be the right time.  My kids are 8 and 10 now, and I'm finally getting some sleep, and I have actual time for hobbies.  I encourage you to get the mechanical stuff in place - instruments, recording software, etc.
1502252515714220035 2022-03-11 21:58:04 +1000 <ErikRobson> Used well, they hurt.  (In the good way.)  I can see that now, and it's a weird feeling.
1502252514690809857 2022-03-11 21:58:04 +1000 <ErikRobson> At 50, I have a clear-as-crystal understanding that x7 chords (first and foremost) live within a context.  What came before?  What comes after?  That's the entire thing.  Beyond that, x7 chords are an amazing place to store irony.  Actual, straight-to-the-heart irony.
1502252513583505424 2022-03-11 21:58:04 +1000 <ErikRobson> Last music note for the evening/morning: In my late teens/early 20's, composing, I absolutely despised x7 chords.  (G7, etc.  NOT maj7.)  I thought they were corny, zany, and bland.  They were Leno.

1502248283879534592 2022-03-11 21:41:15 +1000 <ErikRobson> And then I gotta go through all the permutations of the chord to see if I'm confusing "interesting" and "complex" with "the most predictable next chord." ü§™
1502248282617118720 2022-03-11 21:41:15 +1000 <ErikRobson> It's annoying how similar music feels to programming now that I'm old and wise.  Oh, the chord that feels right here is... C#7sus2sus4?  (It's peppy!)  But wait... that's a pretty complicated chord description.  Crap, what if it's a much simpler chord in disguise?!?
